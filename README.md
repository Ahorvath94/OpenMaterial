# OpenMaterial
A repository with the intent of aggregating accurate material properties for mechanical and thermal design with the use of MIL-HDBK-5J, an aerospace engineering materials resource. The intent of this repository is to allow software such as python, MATLAB or FEA tools to quickly import material data for design purposes.

MIL-HDBK-5J

To do:

Add ultimate tensile strength, ultimate shear strength, ultimate compressive strength, yield strength, density and young's modulus to excel sheet for each material in MIL-HDBK-5J.
Add thermal conductivity for each material.
